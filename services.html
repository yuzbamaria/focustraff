            <h5>Technical SEO</h5>
            <p> Technical website optimization embraces a set of actions which help to improve user experience (UX) and enable search engines crawl the website. Our SEO team will provide a deep technical audit of your website to ensure that it is configured correctly and can be easily crawled and indexed by search engines. 
                Before the site starts appearing in search results, it’s necessary to show to search robots that the site is useful. Thus, if your website is live, let’s say, for 2 years but still is not ranking, then it should be checked for technical issues which should be detected and eliminated. As an example, if your website pages load slowly, users will more likely leave the website which leads to the profit loss. User behaviors like this may signal that your site doesn’t create a positive user experience. As a result, Google may not rank your site well. Besides, in our experience we have cases when client’s sites lost potential customers because of improper categorization of goods and poor website navigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most common technical issues hampering website SEO health are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sitemap absence</li>
                <li>Non SEO-friendly site structure</li>
                <li>Low website load speed</li>
                <li> Website is not mobile-friendly</li>

            </ul>

            <h5>Commercial factors SEO check-up</h5>
            <p>Quite often SEO specialists tend to create the ideal technical image of the website for search robots, meanwhile forgetting about the end user.

            <h5>SEO consulting</h5>
            <p>SEO is crucial for driving traffic to websites and increasing their chances of being discovered by potential customers through search engines.  Each website is individual, that’s why there is no universal cure in search engine optimization. Not every website needs a full-stack SEO. Each case should be dealt and assessed individually. For one site it will be enough to conduct a technical SEO analysis, while for another it will be sufficient to apply a properly set link-building strategy only. 
            </p>
            <p>For our clients we render the following SEO services both in a full-stack package or as a standalone service:
            </p>

                <li>Technical SEO</li>
                <li>Commercial factors SEO check-up </li>

            <h5>Google penalty recovery
            </h5>
            <p>Google penalties can significantly impact a website's search engine rankings and visibility, leading to a decrease in organic traffic and potentially harming the overall online presence of a business or individual.
            </p>
            <p>Google penalties can be broadly categorized into two main types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Algorithmic Penalties: These are automatic penalties triggered by Google's algorithms when they detect certain violations of their guidelines. Examples include Panda, Penguin, and the more recent Core Web Vitals update. Algorithmic penalties often involve issues related to content quality, link spam, user experience, and technical performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Manual Penalties: These are penalties imposed by Google's human reviewers after they manually assess a website and find it in violation of Google's guidelines. Manual penalties are usually more severe and may require more extensive efforts to recover from. They often result from actions like unnatural link building, cloaking, keyword stuffing, and other forms of black-hat SEO.
                </li>             
            </ul>
            <p>Google penalty recovery typically involves the following steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Penalty Identification</li>
                <li>Audit and Analysis</li>
                <li>Issue Resolution</li>
                <li>Content Improvement  (content may need to be revised and improved to meet Google's quality standards and provide value to users)</li>
                <li>Backlink Cleanup (if the penalty is related to unnatural or spammy backlinks, a process of disavowing or removing such links may be necessary)</li>
                <li>Reconsideration Request (Manual Penalty)</li>
                <li>Monitoring and Reporting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's important to note that recovering from a Google penalty can be a complex and time-consuming process, and success depends on multiple factors. Our SEO team has wide experience with successful cases in this field as we always face the problem from different angles and try to apply creative non-standard methods.

            <h5>Content analysis and strategy
            </h5>
            <p>In today's digital landscape, crafting compelling, relevant, and optimized content is crucial for driving organic traffic, improving search engine rankings, and enhancing overall online visibility.

Nowadays piling up the page with multiple keywords is not that efficient. Based on numerous semantic analysis and cooperative work of linguists and programmers, search robots have learned to detect useful and informative content. Therefore comes the main rule – put yourself in the shoes of your clients and create content for end users first.

            </p>
